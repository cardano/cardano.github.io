# [QCon](https://qconlondon.com/)
This was my first experience of QCon.  I had seen some of the InfoQ material on the sister website and was hoping to see the quality reflected in the conference.  I was not disappointed.  The venue although cramped around the lifts and toilets was well presented and located.  I rate the food highly, the attention to quality here was evident: beverages in every break, decent snacks and a balanced tasty but healthy lunch.  Afterall if you don't have decent fuel in your engine, how can you expect the car to perform?  I'd been to other multi-day conferences where the tracks persisted across the whole duration, but here the tracks changed daily.  I thought this worked really well, to fulfil the goal of keeping up with technology in a broad way.

# Topics
I hardly know where to start- throughout the day I had trouble working out which talks to choose between because so many were enticing.  In the end I followed my gut as to what would be applicable in the workplace.
